CounterSetName           Description
--------------           -----------
Processor                The Processor performance object consists of counters that measure aspects of processor
                         activity. The processor is the part of the computer that performs arithmetic and logical
                         computations, initiates operations on peripherals, and runs the threads of processes.  A
                         computer can have multiple processors.  The processor object represents each processor as an
                         instance of the object.
Memory                   The Memory performance object  consists of counters that describe the behavior of physical
                         and virtual memory on the computer.  Physical memory is the amount of random access memory on
                         the computer.  Virtual memory consists of the space in physical memory and on disk.  Many of
                         the memory counters monitor paging, which is the movement of pages of code and data between
                         disk and physical memory.  Excessive paging, a symptom of a memory shortage, can cause delays
                         which interfere with all system processes.
Network QoS Policy       This counter set consists of flow statistics specific to a network QoS policy.
Network Interface        The Network Interface performance object consists of counters that measure the rates at which
                         bytes and packets are sent and received over a network connection.  It includes counters that
                         monitor connection errors.
Network Adapter          The Network Adapter performance object consists of counters that measure the rates at which
                         bytes and packets are sent and received over a physical or virtual network connection.  It
                         includes counters that monitor connection errors.
FileSystem Disk Activity The FileSystem Disk Activity performance counter set consists of counters that measure the
                         aspect of filesystem's IO Activity.  This counter set measures the number of bytes filesystem
                         read from and wrote to the disk drive.
LogicalDisk              The Logical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor logical partitions of a
                         hard or fixed disk drives.  Performance Monitor identifies logical disks by their a drive
                         letter, such as C.
PhysicalDisk             The Physical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor hard or fixed disk
                         drive on a computer.  Disks are used to store file, program, and paging data and are read to
                         retrieve these items, and written to record changes to them.  The values of physical disk
                         counters are sums of the values of the logical disks (or partitions) into which they are
                         divided.

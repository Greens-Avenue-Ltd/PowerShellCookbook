Nothing new to add

### Page 92 - Step 2

This step should read:

    Get-WindowsFeature |
        Where-Object Installed


### Page 92 - Step 3

This step should read:

    $WSUSContentDir = 'C:\WSUS'
    If (-Not (Get-ChildItem -Path $WSUSContentDir -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue))
        {New-Item -Path $WSUSContentDir -ItemType Directory}


 
### Page 92 - Step 4

This step should read:

    & "$env:ProgramFiles\Update Services\Tools\WsusUtil.exe"  `
        Postinstall CONTENT_DIR=$WSUSContentDir
Also- this step can take quite a while after the message 'Post install is starting' is 
first displayed.

This step generates a message that notes the generated log file - this is needed for step 5


### Page 92 - Step 4

In this step you look at the log file generated by `WsusUtil`. The log file is generated
in the `$env:TEMP` folder and varies. Adjust this step to use the log file generated by step 4.

### Page 94 - Step 13

In the published book, step 14 started:

    $WSUSSubscription.StartSynchronizationForCategoryOnly()

This did not seem to work so the step was changed (and now works, so as to read:

    $WSUSSubscription.StartSynchronization()
    Do {
         Write-Output $WSUSSubscription.GetSynchronizationProgress()
         Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
       } 
    While ($WSUSSubscription.GetSynchronizationStatus() -ne `
              'NotProcessing')
